# Viterbi-Algorithm

## Description:
In this project we implement the Viterbi algorithm for this diagram:

We need to find the most probable sequence of states (α/β) for the input "GGCT".
Based on the given diagram we have the following data and input:

Of course the algorithm works with different probabilities and inputs.

## Some more info:
- The code runs for Python 2.
- There are plenty of comments inside the .py file to help with the understanding of the code.
- This repository was created to help others in need but also to show the experience i gained as a student.
